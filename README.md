# Vim syntax highlighting for dPASP

More info on [dPASP: A Flexible Differentiable Probabilistic Answer Set Programming Environment for
Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning](https://kamel.ime.usp.br/dpasp).

This is a modification of Roland Kaminski's [vim-syntax-clingo](https://github.com/rkaminsk/vim-syntax-clingo)
for the purpose of syntax highlighting a probabilistic extension of clingo: dPASP.
